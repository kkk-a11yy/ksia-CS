I have 5 of these flash drives, some are really old, never failed me:
16GB - https://geni.us/lxlV
32GB - https://geni.us/oUoh


At higher levels of storage it is recommended that you opt for a hard drive:
1TB - https://geni.us/wwk25DU
4TB (Much better bang for buck) - https://geni.us/q9eGaop


Network Attached Storage (NAS) 
Best Value:
